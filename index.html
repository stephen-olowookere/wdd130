        <img src="week01/images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, My name is Olowookere Oluwabori Stephen" width="200">
        <p> I am Olowookere Oluwabori Stephen, a passionate and growth-driven technology learner currently studying at
            Ladoke
            Akintola University of Technology and advancing my foundational software development skills through Brigham
            Young
            University–Pathway Worldwide.

            As a software developer in training, I am committed to learning programming fundamentals, building projects,
            and
            understanding how technology can be applied to improve efficiency and solve real-world challenges. I am
            driven by
            curiosity, creativity, and a strong desire to contribute to innovations that support the world’s evolving
            tech
            landscape.

            I believe in teamwork, collaboration, and continuous self-development as key drivers of success. My goal is
            to grow into
            a highly skilled software developer who contributes to value-creating technological solutions while
            supporting strategic
            growth across industries.

            My Christian faith guides my principles of integrity, service, and excellence in everything I do. I am
            always eager to
            connect with professionals, mentors, and fellow learners to share insights, learn from diverse experiences,
            and explore
            opportunities in the tech ecosystem.</p>
